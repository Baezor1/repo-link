# Repository Linking
This is a script that links scripts in public repositories to your Minecraft server. You can easily link repositories to multiple servers by using this! For example, I'm using this to link code between my network for redis stuff!

# Dependencies
You only need one addon for this! [Skent](https://github.com/Olyno/skent)!

# How to Use This!
1. Place the `repoLink.sk` file inside of your scripts folder. Before you reload, make sure you have the addon Skent installed!
2. Create a public repository on github.
3. Create a `repo-link` folder inside of the repository.
4. Put any scripts you want to link inside of this.
5. Open the `repoLink.sk` folder and add your repository string into the repository list.
6. Run the command `/reporeload` or restart your server!
